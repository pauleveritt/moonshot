  <h1>What is ui-router?</h1>

  <p>URL routing is a popular way to match the contents of a URL
    to specific functionality within a website. URL routes
    programmatically present specific content to
    users based on the URL that they are
    visiting. It is a popular way that has proven to be very
    effective.</p>

  <p>AngularJS supplies URL routing by default. It is adequate, but also
    has some limitations.</p>

    <a ui-sref="bogus">Bogus link that should trigger NotFound</a>
    and
    <a ui-sref="busted">Busted state with an error in resolve</a>.
