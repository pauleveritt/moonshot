  <h3>What is ui-router?</h3>

  <p>URL routing is a popular approach to matching the contents of a URL
    to specific functionality within a web
    application. URL routes programmatically present specific content to
    users based on the URL that they are
    visiting. It is a popular approach that has proven to be very
    effective.</p>

  <P>Something that might not be obvious is that URL routing is also a
    finite state machine. When you configure
    the routing for an app, you are laying out the various states the
    application can be in, and informing the
    application what to display and do when a specific route is
    encountered.</P>

  <p>AngularJS supplies URL routing by default. It is adequate, but also
    has some limitations.</p>
